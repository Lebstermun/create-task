  <h3 align=center>You follow the trail until you see the native waiting at a nearby bridge which is over a large revene and at the other side of the bridge is the temple, but about 1/2 mile to your left you see the end of the revene and forest path into the temple. The Native says "oh you survided I thought you had died" you see your compass in the natives hand. Do you take the bridge and trust the native or take the bridge and go solo. </h3>
